Draws a standard keyboard layout in the game window. \
The gamer presses a key in the keyboard when prompted, such as highlighting a key in the window above. Pressing the right one prompts the next letter, and pressing the wrong button, the program waits for the right one to be pressed.

The key hints in the game should be a meaningful C program. For example, outputing hello world,  solving Pi and so on.\
There should be an interface for the player to choose which program to practice.

Regarding the game, it is designed to contain:\
Speed mode: The character falls from the sky, if you do not press the key in time, the character will fall to the ground, smashing a gap. When there are too much gaps, it is considered a failure.\
You can design a character with a reward, and pressing this one will automatically fill in some gaps.\
Scoring rules can be designed.
